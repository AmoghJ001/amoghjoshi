Hi! Welcome to my webpage!

I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor's Degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai. 

I am interested in applying Computer Vision for applications which benefit the society at large. I am particularly interested in understanding and exploring Deep Neural Networks for a variety of problems.
