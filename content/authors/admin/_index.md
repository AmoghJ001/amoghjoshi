Hi! Welcome to my webpage!

I am Computer Science Master's Student at Arizona State University.<br>

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. <br>
I am particularly interested in developing and proposing parameterically efficient lightweight Deep Neural Networks (with faster inference) and evaluating them through the lens of adversarial robustness.
