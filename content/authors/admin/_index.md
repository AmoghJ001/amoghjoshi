Hi! Welcome to my webpage!

I am Computer Science Master's Student at Arizona State University.<br>

Broadly speaking, my interests lie in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. <br>
My research interests span across multiple sub-domains:
<ul>
  <li>I am particularly interested in developing <strong>parameter-efficient Deep Learning approaches</strong>(with faster edge inference) which spans several sub-topics like <strong>Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models</strong>, <strong>Knowledge Distillation</strong>, and also evaluating their <strong>adversarial robustness</strong>.</li>
  <li>I am also interested in exploring <strong>Multi-Modal Vision-Language based approaches</strong>which learn better data representations.</li>
  <li>My research has touched upon several application areas including Medical Image Analysis, Document Classification, Adversarial Robustness etc.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:red">I am highly interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Vision/Deep Learning starting Fall 2024!</p>
