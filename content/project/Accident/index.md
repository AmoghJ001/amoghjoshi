title: Accident Avoidance Alert System For Drivers
summary: Built an Object Detection Model that detects road signs, vehicles and pedestrians and notifies it to the driver by giving a count of objects detected. This can help detect road signs unnoticed by the driver and reduce accidents to a great extent. Won 3rd Prize in IEEE Technical Paper Presentation Competition 2020 held in my college for this research project.
